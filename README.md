## Description

The goal of this project is to build a text editor that runs in the browser and can be downloaded as a PWA (progressive web app). The application should also function offline. The database that is being used is a package that can be downloaded called 'IDB' or IndexedDB database - the site will be deployed on Heroku upon deployment

> Learning how to create a PWA app with the use of IndexDB. This is to see the ability of getting an app to work even if it is offline.

> ### Why did you build this project?
>
> The point of doing this project is to be able to create apps that even work offline for future clients.

> ### What problem does it solve?
>
